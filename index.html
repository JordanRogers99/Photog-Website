    <div class="div-one"><p>Welcome to Jordan Rogers Photography. I have been working as a photographer
        for many years now. I started working events in 2018, originally focused
        on corporate events and eventually transferring over to wedding photography.
        Aside from my career in shooting events, I have also worked as a retoucher in 
        multiple London Studios.
    </p>
    <p>Throughout this website, I hope to direct you to my best work in many different
        areas, and give you the option to contact me for a free quote and consultation.
        I will also aim to show you examles of great artists that I suggest you check out.
    </p></div>
    <p class="para1">Below, a few examples of my work, but you will be able to get a much better outlook
        by viewing my portfolio page.</p>

    <div class="image1"><img class="container" src=" ./images/img3.jpg" alt="A cool picture" height="auto" width="auto">
        <div class="image2"><img class="container" src=" ./images/img2.jpg" alt="A cool picture" height="auto" width="auto">
            <div class="image3"><img class="container" src=" ./images/img4.jpg" alt="A cool picture" height="auto" width="auto">

    <p class="bottom-para">Above, I have included 3 images of my work. These examples are just examples of my own artistic style in 
    photography. This would count as my personal work, which I exhibit in galleries in London and I post 
    regularly on my instagram, which can be found on the <span><a href=
    " ./pages/socials.html">social media</a></span> area of this website. Aside from this, I have an extensive career 
    in shooting both corporate events and weddings. I have always enjoyed shooting these events because I like working
    with a sense of responsibility and importance. My responsibilities as a wedding photography far out-weigh my
    responsibilities in most fields within the medium of photography and I enjoy this greatly. </p>
