    <h1 class="title">Jordan Rogers Photography</h1>
    <div class="div-one"><p>Welcome to Jordan Rogers Photography. I have been working as a photographer
        for many years now. I started working events in 2018, originally focused
        on corporate events and eventually transferring over to wedding photography.
        Aside from my career in shooting events, I have also worked as a retoucher in 
        multiple London Studios.
    </p>
    <p>Throughout this website, I hope to direct you to my best work in many different
        areas, and give you the option to contact me for a free quote and consultation.
    </p></div>
    <p>Below, a few examples of my work, but you will be able to get a much better outlook
        by viewing my portfolio page.</p>
