# Photog-Website
I am going to slowly build a website to showcase photography.
The idea behind this is primarily just to have a website where I can continue to improve and test
my coding chops. I have been working on a project already but it sort of begun with no point and there
is nowhere to go with it and not a lot of importance on how it goes. I would like to put together a website 
that eventually looks better than my Wix sites that I worked on for years before.
